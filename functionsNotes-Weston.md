# SQL Server Functions
- SQL Server provides many different functions to perform tasks on your data collections.
- functions are basically sets of SQL statements that accept only input parameters, perform actions and then return a result.
- functions can only return a single value or a table.
- functions don't perform crud operations on a database, just reinterpret existing data into a temporary format/table.
- SQL Server function types
    - Scalar - Operate on and return a single value.
    - Aggregate - operate on a collection of values and return a single value
    - tabular functions - return a table type as a result of actions performed by the function
        - depending on what the result of the function is, it would choose to include results of the passed in table
